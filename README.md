# U2b - React challenge

U2b is a single page application made with React. 

U2b allows you to view and search youtube videos. You can also get details of a selected video.

## Usage

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install and update all the U2b dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

Then, you should make an .env.local file with your youtube API KEY. This environment variable should be named REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY

To run the app in development mode, use the command
```bash
npm run start
```
